      <h2>Title 1</h2>
      <p>
       It's strange that a 22 years old  is building a static website from scratch in 2025. 
       In particular it is pretty strange someone wants to create a website in the LLM ages. 
       I am going to explain why in the next three points.
      </p>

    <div class="paragraph">
      <h2> It's a matter of definitions.</h2>
      <p>
      I'm stupid if you define an efficient way to share content as one which reaches as many people as possible; 
      however, this is neither my definition nor my goal; for that goal, 
      there are better platform like TikTok or Instagram. 
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
      <h2>It isn't for you, it's for me.</h2>
      <p>
       I want to describe my journey into computer science. I would share what I learn, my ideas and my mistakes. 
       Furthermore, In my opinion, explaining to other people what you learn and building project from zero are the best things to do in order to understand something; 
       hence a website is the best tool to share long form text content like these. I hope my experience will be useful for you too. 
      </p>

     <div class="paragraph">
      <h2>Use only what you need</h2>
      <p>
        I could have used wordpress or similar CMS in order to build this website, but I wouldn't have understood anything; 
        this isn't what I'm looking for. In addition, it isn't necessary some powerful and complicated frameworks to share some text content.
